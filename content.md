# Database Architecture Practice: Todo List

Let's get some more practice designing databases. This time, we'll design a data model for an app called Todo List.

## Todo List

Before you begin, remind yourself of [our goal](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/320-yap-database-architecture#our-goal), and our [two database constraints](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/320-yap-database-architecture#database-design-constraint-one).

Then, click around [Todo List](https://ujs-practice-1.matchthetarget.com/), another app we might build during this course:

You can sign in with any of the following (all of their passwords are **password**):

- alice@example.com
- bob@example.com
- carol@example.com
- eve@example.com
- Or you can sign up for your own new account (it doesn't need to be a real email address).

It's aim is simple; it allows you to keep track of the status of your todo list items.

Try to figure out what database tables back this app. In order to test your database design, what questions can you ask? "Are we able to...?"

What tables and columns will you need? Try to produce a complete list of tables and columns.

Imagine that it's a mockup, and that you've been hired to build an app like that. (Don't come up with additional features or improvements; our job is to build it as it is now.)

I find it helpful to use paper or a spreadsheet to actually draw out all my tables, columns, and try entering in rows to make sure I can record everything necessary for all screens and possible user actions that I can see in the mockup.

Please create a spreadsheet using [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and share your url. It should be something like this: `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/<...>`. Make sure anyone with the link can view.

- Enter your `docs.google.com/spreadsheets` shared URL:
- `docs.google.com/spreadsheets`
  - Great job!
- any
  - Not quite. Make sure the URL looks like: `docs.google.com/spreadsheets`
{: .free_text #github_profile_url title="GitHub profile URL" points="1" answer="1" }

<div class="alert alert-danger mt-2">

After you submit the URL here, return to Canvas and submit the URL again in the assignment "Todo List: Spreadsheet".

An instructor will provide additional feedback on your submission there.
